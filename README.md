# Todo List / Task Manager

This is a simple Todo List web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s a small project I made to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates in JavaScript.

## Features

- Add new tasks with an optional due date
- Delete tasks easily
- Displays tasks in a clean, scrollable list
- Shows a message when no tasks exist (empty state)
- Responsive design with a visually appealing layout

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## What I Learned

- Handling user input and updating the DOM dynamically
- Using arrays and functions to manage tasks
- Formatting dates for display
- Styling interactive components like buttons and input fields

## Future Improvements

- Save tasks in localStorage so they persist after page reload
- Add task editing functionality
- Add task filtering and sorting by due date
- Add notifications or reminders for due tasks
